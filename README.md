# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains code for the Titanic dataset challenge from Kaggle. The aim of this project for me was not to attain a very high accuracy, but to get used to using pandas and all the features it has to offer. Some basic plots were created to evaluate the data which can bee seen below. 
The highest accuracy achieved with this code was 84%.
